/**
 * The platform section: a headline, two actions, then two large cards and
 * three smaller ones.
 *
 * THE LAYOUT IS THE DELIVERABLE HERE. The cards' contents were explicitly not
 * in scope, so each one has its headline, its arrow, and an empty well where
 * the preview goes. The well is deliberately empty rather than filled with a
 * drawn approximation of a UI: a fake screenshot of software that does not
 * exist is the most convincing lie a page like this can tell, and it would
 * have to be thrown away the moment a real one exists.
 *
 * AND THE PLATFORM ITSELF DOES NOT EXIST — same standing note as the nav
 * panel it shares its copy with. No route, nothing in Sanity, no surface a
 * client logs into. The headlines below are the ones already written for that
 * panel, so the two cannot drift apart; the arrows do not link anywhere yet.
 *
 * The reference splits each headline in two weights — the subject in full
 * white, the rest muted — which is what lets a two-line headline still read
 * as one phrase. `lead` and `rest` are that split.

/* Two of the nav panel's six are not cards here.

   Guardrails is cut. Library was already out. Both still appear in the
   Platform dropdown, which is the fuller list — the section is the argument,
   the menu is the index, and they do not have to be the same length.

   Agents moved down to the second row, which leaves Brand Repository alone
   first. It takes the whole width there rather than sitting at half with a
   hole beside it: one card in a two-column row is a gap, and a gap in a
   section this sparse reads as something failing to load. */
